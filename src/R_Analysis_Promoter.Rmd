Load Promoter prediction data
```{r}
Promoter = read.table('fabg1G609A.fasta_output.txt', header=T, sep='\t')
```

Attach dataset
```{r}
str(Promoter)
attach(Promoter)
```
Call ggplot2
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Plot linegraph with ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(Promoter, aes(x=Position, y=Percent.Accuracy)) +  geom_line()
```
Use geom smooth to see the curve to see region that has highest percent accuracy, which is where promoter region is
```{r}
plot = ggplot(Promoter, aes(x=Position, y=Percent.Accuracy)) +  geom_point()+ geom_smooth(span=0.1)
plot
```
